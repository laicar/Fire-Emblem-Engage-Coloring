# Fire-Emblem-Engage-Coloring
A C# program that takes Fire Emblem Engage red scale sprites and palettes to color sprites. Made by [Eclogia](https://www.reddit.com/user/eclogia).

# Usage:
Provide the following folders' path as command-line arguments in order: raw (red scale) sprites, palettes, output

# Limitations
Either the palette I received are extracted wrong, or there is an extra step I don't know the nature of, which makes in-game sprites lighter-colored than those output by this program. It's still better than the red scale version of the sprites in terms of community usability, but know that this is not totally accurate to the game.
